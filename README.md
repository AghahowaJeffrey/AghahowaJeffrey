WHY I GOT INTO PROGRAMMING?
Programming has always been something that seems to blow my mind away, even when I had no idea what it was. 
I have always been fascinated by it right from a very young age. The fact that I could solve problems, create, invent,
and put things together and see them come to life has always been my drive.
