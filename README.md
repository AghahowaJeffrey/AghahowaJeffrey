WHY I GOT INTO PROGRAMMING?
Programming has always been something that seems to blow my mind away, even when i had no idea what it was. 
I have always been facinated by it right from a very young age. The fact that i could solve probems, create, invent
and put things together and see them come to live has always beeen my drive.
